The game that shares its profits with players. https://satlantis.net/  

**THIS GAME IS CURRENTLY IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL**

----------

_Satlantest_ is the Minetest implementation of the _Satlantis_ Minecraft server. Satlantest aims to replicate the core features of the original Satlantis server, develop a more cohesive theme and environment, and reach more players than ever before.

"Satlantis" is still the proper title, unless referring specifically to the Minetest implementation of Satlantis.
